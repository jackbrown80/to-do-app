# React To-Do App

Simple to-do application where a user can add and remove items from their list. 

## What I Learnt

This project was a really good test to see if I knew the basics of React. It is the first react project I have done by myself (without a tutorial) and I wanted to use it to test what I learnt in Wesbos React for Beginners course. When I first developed the app, I used Classes and Lifecycle methods like componentDidMount etc. But, then refactored it to use react hooks. Eventhough the functionality is exactly the same, I am happy I did this at is highlighted the difference between the two.

Overall I implemented:
* Declaring state using useState
* Updating and removing state
* Use of components and props
* LocalStorage to persist data
* Component lifecycle methods and useEffect
* CSS/React animations
